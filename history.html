      <h3><b>Early History</b></h3>
      <p>Running has a long and storied history. Humans first developed the ability
        to run over long distances about 2.6 million years ago. It was first used as
        a way to hunt but quickly became one of the first competitive sports. An early
        example of a competitive racing occured at the first recorded Olympics Games in
        776 BCE. Another great example of running in the ancient world is the legendary
        marathon runner Pheidippides. He supposedly ran 26 miles to deliver news of a great
        victory and died doing so. </p>
      <h3><b>Modern Day</b></h3>
      <p>Training and running technique contunied through the years allowing athletes to
        reach accomplishments many thought were impossible. The best example of this is
        when Roger Bannister broke 4 minutes in the mile(he is featured to the right).
        Other barriers like breaking 10 seconds in the 100 meter dash fell as well. Today
        the next great barrier that many search to break is 2 hours in the marathon.</p>
      <h3><b>Running Today</b><h3>
      <p class="size">Though running is one of the most pure forms of competition while also being one
        of the most accessible sports out there it also has had it fair share of controversy. Athletes
        who abuse different substances like EPO taint the sport and the achievement of other athletes.
        Today when a new world record set their is always doubt it was done with out the help of banned
        substances. No one wants to watch a sport where everyone is already assumed to be a cheater.</p>
