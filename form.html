      <h3><b>Why is Form so Important?</b></h3>
      <p>Form is what often takes a runner from just being good to being great.
        When you reach the top of the sport every advantage that you can get is
        needed. If you can be just 1% more efficient that makes a huge difference
        whether you are looking to drop .01 of your 100m time or running a marathon.
        Form is also one of the most difficult skills to perfect. Trying to change
        and perfect form is one the hardest things to do in running and is a never
        ending process.</p>
      <h3><b>What is Good Form?</b></h3>
      <p>The main purpose of running is to go forward faster than anyone. Form is
        all about using the energy that you create the most effecient way possible.
        Any movement that is moving side to side is wasting energy. As you can see
        in the picture of Bolt to the right, the angles that you land and take off at
        are extermely important when it comes to energy return. Your overall posture
        and where your foot lands and the position of your foot are all key parts to
        running form.</p>
      <h3><b>How to Improve Form</b><h3>
      <p class="size">Improving your running is form a long and arduous process that takes place
        over many years. The first step is focusing on form while you are training.
        That way when it comes time to race it comes naturally to you instead of
        of thinking about it. Doing form drills like different types of skips and
        other exercises will help reinforce the important basics to good running form.
        Stength training can also be very effective because keeping good form is difficult
        while racing and requires good core strength to keep you upright.</p>
